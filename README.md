Description: This game is a beginner-friendly C programming project to enhance foundational programming skills. The game features an 8x8 grid array where players compete to win with the following elements:

1.	Player Setup: Standard player setup with two players
2.	Menu: There will be a menu for user selection, either for coin flip or exit the game
3.	Unique Player Symbols: The program uses x and o as a standard for better visualization.
4.	Wormholes and Traps: There will be three traps and three wormhole spawns independently in each row and column, minus the 1 row and column.
o	Wormhole: Transports the player’s disc to another row.
o	Trap: Trap with another player disc.
5.	Snakes: These are randomly spawned small cubes that remove a player’s disc from the grid when encountered.
6.	Coin Flip: using the coin flip to randomly start for player 1 or 2, in a coin flip animation.
7.	Exit Option: Players can type "exit" to quit the game anytime.
8.	Winner Recording: The program outputs the winner(s) to a text file for record-keeping.
9.	Core Programming Concepts:
o	Uses pointers and pass-by-value arrays for efficient memory handling.
o	Employs file I/O to save game results.
10.	Error Handling: Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs, such as choosing the same symbol or invalid commands.
